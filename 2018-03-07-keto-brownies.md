# Keto Brownies
*Source (copied verbatim): https://www.gnom-gnom.com/fudgey-cocoa-paleo-keto-brownies/*

## Ingredients
*Yes, I kept the metric measurements because baking by weight yields the best results*

* 130 g unsalted butter or coconut oil
* 200 g Granular sweetener replacement
* 80 g cocoa powder
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 eggs at room temperature
* 70 g almond flour

## Instructions

1. Position a rack in the lower third of your oven and preheat to 350°F/180°C. Line with parchment paper the bottom and sides of a 8x8-inch baking pan. Set aside. 
2. Add butter, sweetener, cocoa powder and salt to a medium heatproof bowl. Melt over a water bath or using the microwave. You will want to heat it up until all the butter and sweetener has melted and the mixture is well incorporated. Remove from heat and allow the mixture to cool slightly. 
3. Add one egg at a time, stirring well after each one until completely incorporated. Add almond flour, stirring vigorously until fully blended (about a minute). Pour into prepared pan. 
4. Bake for 15-25 minutes, or until the center is just set and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out slightly moist.
5. Sprinkle with flakey sea salt (optional) and allow to cool completely on a rack. Lift brownies using the edges of the parchment paper and cut into desired size. To get extra clean edges, place in the freezer for 10 minutes prior to cutting. 

### Notes
I did a test run before the stream, holy crap these are good. The texture ended up being similar to fudge, I wonder if I made them wrong ^^;
