# Low Carb Budae Jjigae
This is one of my favorite dishes so I was sure to make it in time for my birthday. :D

I took an approach similar to the recipe here (https://nomnomprincess.com/2015/06/27/low-carb-korean-army-stew-budae-jigae/) with some exceptions:

- I cook everything in one pot in the end
- I found the spam to be much more enjoyable if you fry it ahead of time, it gives it a nicer texture.
