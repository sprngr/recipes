# Cheese Steak

Going to be frank here, it's cheese and steak - peppers and onions if you so desire. 

Advice for the steak, freeze it for 30 mins first so when you slice it you can get thinner pieces.

Cook your veggies ahead of time, then set aside.

Cook steak strips until it is well seared. Try to pull apart as much as you can while cooking.
