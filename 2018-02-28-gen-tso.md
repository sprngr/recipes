# Low Carb Gen Tso's Chicken
*Note: Any protein can be used, requiring additional preparation, but for the writeup I'm going with chicken. Your mileage may vary.*

## Ingredients

### Protein & Breading
* 1 lb chicken (breast meat or deboned thighs work) - cubed
* 3/4 cup crushed pork Rinds
* 1/3 cup almond flour
* 2 large eggs

### Veggies
* (optional) 1 - 2 cup broccoli florets (you can save time on this step and get frozen broccoli)

### Sauce
* 1/2 tsp sesame oil
* 3 tbsp unseasoned (sugar free) rice vinegar
* 2 tsp white vinegar
* 3 tbsp wheat free soy sauce (or coconut aminos)
* 1/4 cup water
* 3 tbsp granulated sugar substitute
* 1/2 tsp xanthan gum
* 1/4 cup scallions, chopped
* 1/2 tsp ground ginger
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tsp chili paste
* 1 tsp red pepper flake
* 5 small dried chillies chopped

### Oils
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1 tbsp coconut oil

## Instructions

### Chicken pt 1
1. Cube your chicken
2. Whisk 2 eggs together in a bowl, set aside.
3. Combine pork rinds and almond flour together in another bowl.
4. For each piece of chicken, dredge in egg, then breading, then egg again, and once more in breading - set aside on a cookie sheet.

### Chicken pt 2

1. In a skillet, add the oils and allow set to a medium-high heat.
2. Carefully add chicken to the oil, be sure to not over crowd (do in groups if necessary.
3. Occasionally turn the chicken to make sure it is thoroughly cooked.
4. Once cooked, set aside on a cookie sheet lined with paper towel to let dry.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for all chicken until finished.

### Sauce
Whisk together in a bowl all sauce ingredients with the exception of the xanthan gum, reserve that for the last step because it will cause things to thicken up quickly. 

Set aside sauce for the remaining step.

### Combining it all together
In skillet or wok on a medium-high heat, place chicken (and veggies if you choose to), covering in sauce and gently stirring together. 

Cook for a few minutes, spend a couple extra to be sure your chicken is cooked thoroughly, and serve.
