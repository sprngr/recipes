# Pork Ramen
*This recipe uses shirataki noodles, but if you don't care to keep it lower carb you can use actual ramen noodles*

*This recipe is also being recreated from memory - Some things may not be 100% accurate*

## Ingredients

- 1 package noodles (I used shirataki)

- Pork (I used boneless spare ribs)
- Ginger
- Garlic
- Sesame oil

- 1 Onion, diced
- 1 Leek, diced
- 1 pack Shiitake mushrooms, diced
- 1 bunch green onions, chopped

- 1 can chicken broth
- Soy Sauce

## Instructions

Chop all vegetables, set aside.

Prepare the noodles according to package instructions, set aside.

Take the diced onions, place into pot and [caramelize](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_caramelize_onions/). Have fun; this takes a while.

Once the onions are caramlized, using the chicken broth deglaze it.
At this point, combine all vegetables (except green onion) into the pot with about a cup of water.
Once it begins to boil, lower heat and let simmer for 10-20 mins (more time won't hurt but to be honest I wasn't watching the clock either)

While the soup is cooking, prepare your pork. Because the spare ribs I used were thicker, I sliced them into thinner strips.
In a skillet, add sesame oil, ginger, and garlic. Cook until garlic is fragrant.
Add in strips of pork to skillet. Include a layer of soy sauce just enough to cover the bottom of the skillet.
Cook pork until cooked all the way through, turning occasionally to incorporate the soy sauce/ginger/garlic mixture with it.

Once everything is complete, assemble in bowl: noodles, soup, pork, and green onions.

Enjoy.
