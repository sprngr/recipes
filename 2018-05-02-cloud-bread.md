# Cloud Bread

Cloud bread is an alternative low carb bread I've been meaning to try, the recipe couldn't be simpler!

## Ingredients

* 4 large eggs, separated
* 1/2 tsp cream of tartar
* 2 oz cream cheese
* 1 tsp italian seasoning
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp garlic

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Separate the egg whites and egg yolks. Place the whites in a stand mixer with a whip attachment. Add the cream of tartar and beat on high until the froth turns into firm meringue peaks. Move to a separate bowl.
3. Place the cream cheese in the empty stand mixing bowl. Beat on high to soften. Then add the egg yolks one at a time to incorporate. Scrape the bowl and beat until the mixture is completely smooth. Then beat in the Italian seasoning, salt, and garlic powder.
4. Gently fold the firm meringue into the yolk mixture. Try to deflate the meringue as little as possible, so the mixture is still firm and foamy. Spoon 1/4 cup portions of the foam onto the baking sheets and spread into even 4 inch circles, 3/4 inch high. Make sure to leave space around each circle.
5. Bake on convect for 15-18 minutes, or in a conventional oven for up to 30 minutes. The bread should be golden on the outside and firm. The center should not jiggle when shaken. Cool for several minutes on the baking sheets, then move and serve!
