# Keto Haluski

## It's haluski except the noodles are fathead dough.

I don't really have a complete recipe set here except to make the haluski like normal, except for the noodles.

In place of noodles, makea small amount of fathead dough:
- 1 egg
- 1 oz cream cheese
- 1 cup mozzerella
- 1 tbsp of almond flour

And spread it out thin on a piece of parchment paper, bake at 400ยบ F for 10-12 minutes.

Let it cool and cut into strips, or to whatever your desired length is. After cooking the cabbage and meat, add in the noodles.
