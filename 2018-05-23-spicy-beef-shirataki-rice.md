# Spicy Beef Over Shirataki Rice with Onsen Egg

There isn't terribly much here in terms of a recipe, most of this was done off the cuff. The only thing it is important you stick to
is the preparation of shirataki - it's quite particular.

For the shirataki rice, I prepared it according to the manufacturer's directions (https://miraclenoodle.com/products/miracle-rice).
- drain
- rinse in cold water
- boil for 2 minutes
- drain
- fry in dry skillet (no oil) on medium heat until water evaporates. I haven't managed to burn it yet

## Spicy Beef
For this, you can use any slice of beef - I used sliced eye of round. I cut the steak into strips, about an inch wide.
I then made a marinade of garlic and chili paste, combined it with the steak in a bowl and let it rest.

To cook, I put it into a skillet with a tsp of sesame oil on med-high heat and cooked until steak was browned.

## Onsen Egg
I followed this, but just for the egg portion https://www.japancentre.com/en/recipes/749-onsen-tamago-eggs

## (Optional) Bean sprouts
Just for some veggies, I boiled 2 cups of bean sprouts in a pot with 1cup beef broth, ginger, garlic, and water. 
Raise temperature to boiling, then reduce back down to medium and let simmer for about 10 minutes.

# Combine
In bowl, place rice, steak, veggies, and egg. It's a simple meal but comes out quite well. Enjoy.
