# Chinese Scallion Pancake
Adapted from https://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2018/02/chinese-scallion-pancakes-happy-new.html

# Important Note - Still very experimental and I'm guessing at this time

## Ingredients

* Sesame Oil
* One bunch green onions sliced thin

### Dough
For the dough, I'm going to use a fathead dough recipe (https://www.lowcarbmaven.com/low-carb-hamburger-buns/) without baking powder.

### Instructions - WIP

1. Follow instructions for dough, wrap in plastic and put in fridge to chill.

2. Chop green onions, set aside.

3. Attempt to make a similar mixture using almond flour to what is done in the original...if that doesn't work, just use sesame oil *shrug*

4. Try to roll out the dough into a flat sheet, apply mixture of oil and green onions.

5. Attempt rolling up the dough lengthwise, then coil it upon itself and flatten again.

6. Add a tsp of oil to skillet on medium-high heat and cook pancake.

I hope this works.
