## Notes
The only thing I'm changing with this is the inclusion of baking powder as well as the full 8 eggs, 
I want to see how that yields since my first loaf was a bit shorter than expected.

Update: Came out fantastic. Will experiment with a touch of vinegar to react with baking powder next as well as a smidgen of cinnamon for slight sweetness.
